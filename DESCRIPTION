Title: Semiparametric generalized linear models for causal inference using targeted machine-learning in high dimensions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lars van der Laan
Maintainer: Lars van der Laan <vanderlaanlars@yahoo.com>
Description: Utilizing the framework of Targeted Maximum-Likelihood estimation (TMLE) and machine-learning,
  robust and efficient estimates and inference can be obtained for user-specified semiparametric generalized linear models including:
  Conditional odds ratios between a binary outcome and binary treatment variables (causal semiparametric logisic regression)
  Conditional additive treatment effects for a continuous outcome (causal semiparametric linear regression with general link functions)
  Conditional relative risk/treatment-effects for a nonnegative outcome (e.g. binary or count) (causal semiparametric relative risk regression with general link functions)
